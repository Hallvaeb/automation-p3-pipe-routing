*Pipe routing for Aker Solutions*

### Product description and selected parameters.

Comprehension story here?

The automatic pipe routing system is created to automatically find the shortest and best path from A  to B, intersecting all necessary equipment in the environment.

Investing in the system will involve:
- Measuring and providing the input of:
1. The environment space.
2. Point A, where path will begin.
3. Point B, where path will end.
4. Coordinates of all equipment the piping must intersect.

In return one will obtain a supposal of where the piping might go to:
- Start in A and end in B.
- Intersect neccessary equipment.

The solution will be provided through ... python with NX Open, or DFA-files.
