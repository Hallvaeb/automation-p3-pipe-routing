### Knowledge base opportunitites

- Equipment can be defined in greater detail and stored for later uses.
- Predefined environments but with ability to edit the contained equipment.

### Diameter decision making

Make it so that the piping diameter is dimensioned from what the equipment with the largest input/output diameter is.

### Obstacles

Obstacles. 

Pipe, create bolt holes for the in and outlets

### Pipes are plummed

Opening them up was harder than imaginged.

## ParameterContainer

There should be a way to use the ID-defined solutions when only specifying number of equs as well. 
The parameter-combinations defined by engineers could have been randomly generated instead, but this
would need more work to be created. If the solution is how it is now, the solutions the engineers
create should rather be added to a knowledge base where one could easily extract all solutions with 
a given number of equipments, specific environment characteristics (like "my environment is less than ..."),
or the one solution with a specific ID.
